I'm Victor Massé from Lyon, France. Writer, developer, activist.

I like mind training, organization, strategy and analysis in regards to well-being and society vision.

I used to practice [Vipassana meditation](https://www.dhamma.org/) but can't anymore because of a [depersonalization-derealization syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization_disorder) there's no treatment for yet.
